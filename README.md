# ESP-NOW Wireless Camera Control with Accelerometer 

Welcome to the ESP-NOW Wireless Camera Control project! This repository showcases a versatile solution for wirelessly controlling an ESP32-CAM using the ESP-Now protocol. The system is enhanced with an accelerometer, allowing intuitive gesture-based commands.

## Features
- Wireless communication using ESP-NOW protocol.
- Integration of an accelerometer for gesture-based control.
- ESP32 WROOM acting as a transmitter, hosted on a breadboard.
- ESP32-CAM enclosed in a 3D-printed frame, providing stability and protection.
- Dual-axis rotation for enhanced camera positioning.

## Project Structure

- **3D_Model:** Stores the 3D printed part models. (Currently not available; I'd like to make some improvements)
- **Images:** Stores project-related images.
- **PCB_Design:** Contains PCB design-related files, relatively simple and hence can easily be done on a perf board. 
- **Source_Code:** Houses the source code for both the transmitter and receiver.
- **README.md:** The main documentation file providing an overview of the project, and features.
